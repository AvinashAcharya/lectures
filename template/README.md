# Lecture Template

## AMath 483/583 Spring 2016

---

A standard template for course lectures. The directory is laid out like so:

```
template/
    README.md            - slides (Markdown)
    Slides.html          - slides (open in browser)
    boilerplate-c/       - boilerplate for C examples
    boilerplate-cython/  - boilerplate for Cython examples
    code/                - code from lecture
```

Because GitHub does not allow rendering of Javascript components in webpages /
Markdown `Slides.html` needs to be opened locally in order to see the
formatting. However, `README.md` is at least available for viewing.

The boilerplate code is there to help with setting up the code for a lecture.
The actual code used in a given lecture will be kept in `code/`
